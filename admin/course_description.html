		<h2>Course Description</h2>
		<p>Computers are a common part of our everyday lives, but... how do they work? How does a computer program make your computer run? The Computer Science course is an introduction to computer programming using the Python language. Topics of study will include object-oriented program design and implementation, program analysis, data structures, control structures, and basic algorithms, along with additional discussion of some of the legal, social, and ethical issues associated with computer use. The course will be largely project-oriented, and require that students spend additional time outside of the course working on a series of programming projects.</p>
		<p>This course is a one-semester elective open to 11th and 12th graders, and is offered only if a sufficient number of students sign up for the course. We will cover a surprising amount of introductory material in the 60-hours that we'll be meeting, from procedure-based to object-oriented programming, from text editors to Integrated Development Environments, from cron job backups to MySQL databases, from programs to packages... all in the context of a Python programming course for beginners.</p>
