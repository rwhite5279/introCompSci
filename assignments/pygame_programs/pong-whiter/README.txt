This folder contains six programs that show progressive development of a Pygame-based Pong game.

Part of the reason I'm sharing this with you is that you can use it to inform some of what you might want to do if you're using Pygame do develop a game of some sort. Mostly though, it's interesting to take a look at how a program is slowly developed from the ground up.

The first 4 versions of the program don't use any functions, so it may be a little bit easier for you to follow the flow of the code. Version 5 is just about getting everything organized into functions, although in a program like this (without objects), it's kind of a pain passing variables back and forth as parameters. (Still it's better than using global variables. DON'T USE GLOBAL VARIABLES!)

Then, once Version 5 is working in function form, Version 6 tries to get things like scoring working.

You probably already realize this by now, but you won't be able to actually run these programs unless you have Pygame installed on your machine. Well, you could if I made an executable out of it, but we haven't really gone into that yet, so... we'll just let that go for now!

By the way, if you're looking for good information, tutorials, examples for Pygame, definitely check out:

Good luck!
