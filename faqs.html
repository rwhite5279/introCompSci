			<h2>About this Course</h2>
			<p>The Polytechnic School <i>Intro to Computer Science</i> course is intended to provide an introduction to some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_basic_computer_science_topics">topics in computer science</a>, especially programming, software engineering, data structures, and algorithms. We'll be conducting our studies using your Mac, PC, or Linux laptop, and be using Python&mdash;a powerful but easy to learn language&mdash;for the majority of our programming.</p>
			<p>In this 13-week course we'll also be interacting with servers via the command line, designing and using databases, and dabbling for a few days in designing a website.</p>
			<p>In 2013-2014, this course will not be offered so that Poly can offer an Advanced Placement Computer Science course.</p>

			<h2>How hard/fun/challenging is this course? Is it the right course for me?</h2>
			<p>You can get some idea of figuring out if this is the right course for you by looking at the course <a href="index.html">schedule</a> and <a href="admin/policies.html">policies</a>, but you should also talk to other people who have taken the class, as well as the instructor. The general idea is that if you're intrigued by the idea of <a href="images/julianchaidez.jpg">solving interesting problems</a>, <a href="images/compsci_room.jpg">writing code</a>, and hacking, then you'll enjoy the challenges posed by this class, and it's a great place to get started. No prior programming experience is required or recommended.</p>			

			<h2>PC or Mac?</h2>
			<p>You can take this course on any machine running Microsoft's Windows, Apple's OS X, or Linux. The instructor runs various machines (Apple, Lenovo, custom Asus desktop) with each of these operating systems, and will use each of them on occasion in class for demonstration purposes. The best hardware at this time, for most students I know&mdash;depending on your own use case, of course!&mdash;is an Apple Macbook Air or <a href="images/macbooksintheclassroom.jpg">Macbook Pro</a>.</p>	

			<h2>My computer died&mdash;can I turn in my assignment late?</h2>
			<p>No. Just as it is expected that you have sufficient resources at school and at home to be able to complete assignments as required for your other academic classes, it is expected that you will make arrangements as required to do the work for this course. That means you need to have access to computer hardware, installed software packages as required for the course, Internet access, and backups of all your work so that you can efficiently recover from unexpected loss of data. See <a href="misc/backups.html">Backing Up Your Data</a> for more information on this topic.</p>
