                            <p>This course is an elective for 11th/12th grade students, and is designed to be an introduction to computer science and software engineering using the Python programming language.</p>
                            <p>Python can be installed on Apple's OS X, Microsoft's Windows, and Unix/Linux OSes.</p>
                            <p>This course doesn't cover computing hardware specifically, although computer programs are run on hardware, and may be used to control hardware.</p>
                            <p>This course <i>does</i> cover <i>programming...</i></p>

                            <p>The textbook for the course is:<br />
                            Zelle, J. 2010. <i><a href="https://fbeedle.com/content/python-programming-introduction-computer-science—2nd-edition">Python Programming: An introduction to computer science</a></i>, Second Edition.</p>
                            <p>Please note that this edition of the book uses Python 3, which is <i>not</i> the version of Python we'll be using in this course&mdash;we'll be using Python 2.7. The differences between the two versions, for the purposes of this course, are minor.</p>
                            
                             <div id="on2" style="padding: 5px;">
									<a href="javascript: expandCollapse('expand2', 'on2');">See differences</a>
								</div>
								<div id="expand2" style="display: none; padding: 5px;">

									<ul>
                                        <li>In version 2.7, parentheses are not required for print statements (although you can include them):
                                        <div class="code">print "Hello, world!"</div>
                                        Version 3.0:
                                        <div class="code">print ("Hello, world!")</div></li>
                                        <li>In version 2.7, the <b>input</b> statement gets a numeric value, and <b>raw_input</b> gets a string value.
                                        <div class="code">userName = raw_input("Enter your name: ")
        userAge = input("Enter your age: ")</div>
                                        In version 3, the <b>input</b> statement gets string values, which must be converted to numeric values using the <b>eval()</b> function:
                                        <div class="code">userName = input("Enter your name: ")
        userAge = eval(input("Enter your age: ")</div></li>
                                        <li>In version 2.7, the division operator <b>/</b>, when working on integers, returns the whole number result only:
                                        <div class="code">>>> <span style="color:#fff">print 7/2</span>
        3</div>
                                        In version 3, the division operator returns a real result:
                                        <div class="code">>>> <span style="color:#fff">print 7/2</span>
        3.5</div></li>
                                    </ul>

								</div>
                            <p>These differences are ones that you'll quickly learn to manage. The textbook is an excellent resource, and the reading provides lots of background material that we won't have time to cover in class.</p>

                            <p>Most people are used to working on a <i>local</i> machine, and you'll certainly be doing that in here. It's often the case, though, that one uses a local machine to access files and services from a distant computer (a <b>server</b>) located somewhere else. There is a server for this class, which you'll be using in lots of ways.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>using <span class="ilc">ssh</span> to run Python (from a PC, you'll need to login using Cygwin)</li>
                                <li>using <span class="ilc">sftp</span> or <span class="ilc">scp</span> to submit assignments (PC requires Cygwin)</li>
                                <li>hosting webpages</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>As mention above, PC users will need to install the <a href="../misc/cygwin.html">Cygwin package</a> to be able to access the class's server.</p>
                            <p>You'll get information from the instructor on how to go about accessing our server. Do not share your login credentials with anyone, and don't do anything silly on our server: storing bad stuff (porn, copyrighted materials, large media files), streaming content, giving access to people not in this course, etc.</p>

                            <p>There will be a number of different types of assignments in this course. You might like to know at the start what types of assignments there are, and how you might be expected to approach them.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>In class exercises</b><br />
                                These will be completed as we develop new material in class. These will be quick examples to help you learn how new commands work, and aren't graded.</li>
                                <li><b>Homework Execises</b><br />
                                These will allow you to practice your skills with a little less guidance. Some of these will be turned in (via the class server) for evaluation by the instructor and credit.</li>
                                <li><b>Online Quizzes</b><br />
                                These will be offered every week or two, and usually accompany an online reading assignment outside of class. Not really anything to stress about.</li>
                                <li><b>Major Projects</b><br />
                                These are longer-term projects that may take anywhere from a few days to a week or more. There will be two "independent" projects included with this, in which you'll have some choice as to what the focus of your project is. You'll receive a separate assignment handout for each of these projects describing the parameters, requirements, etc. These projects are a major factor in your grade, and should be planned for and taken seriously.</li>

                            <p>Computer geeks and programmers, unfortunately, often tend to be loners. That's no fun.</p>
                            <p>There's definitely something to be said for being a self-starter, and bashing away on the computer late into the evening figuring out how this all works. By trying things a few different ways and seeing what works&mdash;and what doesn't&mdash;you can learn an enormous amount. This is the preferred way of picking up programming, but it does take a little time.</p>
                            <p>You can occasionally improve your efficiency (if not your knowledge) by taking advantage of fellow geeks. You should ask other students how they did stuff, or ask the instructor, or Google for assistance when things aren't going the way they should.</p>

                            <p>A text editor is <i>not</i> a word processor. Text editors work with pure text, and have no ability to "make things look pretty" like a word processor does. There are no superscripts or subscripts, no underlining, no bold, and no italics.</p>
                            <p>The advantage to a text editor is that it handles unformatted <i>plain text</i>, which is easier for both computers and programmers to work with. </p>
                            <p>You can choose which text editor you want to work with in here. Some possibilities:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Windows: <b><a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a></b></li>

                                <li>Linux/UNIX, etc: <b>nano</b>, <b>vim</b>, <b>emacs</b>, <b>gedit</b>, <b>pico</b></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>At this stage of the game, for this class you are strongly encouraged to use <b>nano</b>, for a number of reasons: it's free, it's widely available, it's the easiest of the Terminal-based text editors to learn, and it's what you'll be using when you log in to our server. The more practice you have with nano, the easier it's going to be for you to program.</p>

                                    <li>Take a moment to use nano to create a text file called <b>todo.txt</b>, which includes a short list of things you need to do. Save this folder into your <b>notes</b> directory. (How are you planning on doing that?)</li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Machine language</li>
                                <li>Assembly</li>
                                <li>High-level</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The following is a high-level (Python) program:</p>
                            <div class="code">def main():
    user_string = raw_input("Please enter a sentence: ")
    word_list = user_string.split(" ")
    acronym = ""
    for word in word_list:
        acronym = acronym + word[0].capitalize()
    print "Your acronym is",acronym     

main ()</div>
                            <p>Note how this program is made up of words and well-known symbols that include English words as part of the code.</p>
                            <p>This high-level program has to be converted to something to a code&mdash;ultimately a code that just uses 1s and 0s&mdash;that the computer can run. Here is the lower-level hexadecimal code for the same program:</p>

                            <p>Additionally, programs may either be <b>compiled</b>, or <b>interpreted</b>. For a compiled program, the "source code" is given to the computer in advance so that instructions can be converted into a machine language program that will be run directly. An interpreted program is taken by an interpreter that runs the program for you indirectly on the computer.</p>
                            <p>Python runs via an interpreter, which makes it extraordinarily easy to use. Java, used in the AP Computer Science course, is a compiled language: each time you make a change to a program, you have to first recompile the program, and then run the compiled versions of the program.</p>

                            <p>We're going to be using the Python programming language in this course, and there are three ways that you can write and execute Python instructions:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Running Python and executing instructions interactively through the interpreter&mdash;this is handy for learning, but not very good for real programming.</li>
                                <li>Running an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)&mdash;IDEs have lots of tools that can come in handy for very large programs, but are probably not as useful for what we'll be doing.</li>
                                <li>Writing programs using a text editor, then using Python to compile and execute those programs&mdash;this is what we'll be doing most of the time!</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Let's try running Python interactively first.</p>
                            <div class="level4">
                                <h4>3.b.i. Using the Python interpreter</h4>
                                <p>To start the Python interpreter, type <b>python</b> at the command line and hit the [Enter] key:</p>
                                <div class="code">$ <span style="color:#fff">python [Enter]</span>

>>> </div>
                                <p>The <b>>>></b> prompt let's you know that Python is waiting for you to enter an instruction.</p>
                                <div class="problem">
                                    <p>Try this and see what happens:</p>
                                    <div class="code">>>> <span style="color:#fff">print “Hello, world!”</span></div>
                                    <p>Then try a few other statements in the interpreter to see what happens:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>print Hello, world!</li>
                                        <li>print 3+4</li>
                                        <li>print “3+4”</li>
                                        <li>print 3,4</li>
                                        <li>print 34</li>
                                        <li>print 3 4</li>          
                                    </ul>
                                </div>
                                <p>Once you're done with your interactive session, exit by typing "exit()", or holding down the <b>ctrl</b> key while pressing <b>d</b>.</p>
                                <div class="code">>>> <span style="color:#fff">^D</span></div>
                                <p>Executing instructions like this one at a time in the interpreter is kind of cool, especially when you're trying to figure out a command that's new to you, or if you want to experiment real quickly with an idea.</p>
                                <p>There's one big disadvantage, though: if you want to execute your instructions again, you have to type them in again. Usually, it's much better to write a <i>program</i>.</p>

                                <h4>3.b.ii. Using Python to compile and run a program</h4>
                                <p>Before Python can compile and run the program, you have to write the program first, for which you need a text editor.</p>
                                <div class="problem">
                                    <p><b>Do this:</b></p>

                                        <li>In the Terminal, create a directory called "unit1" in your "code" folder. Then <span style="ilc">cd</span> into this folder.</li>
                                        <li>Use <b>nano</b> or another text editor to create the program <b>helloworld-whiter.py</b>.</li>
                                        <li>This program should print out the message "Hello, world!" when it runs, along with the sum of the numbers 1-10 and a personalized goodbye message to you. Once you think you've written the program, save it in your "code/unit1" folder, exit nano, and try running your program:
                                        <div class="code">$ <span style="color:#fff">python helloworld-whiter.py</span></div></li>

                                <p>If your program runs perfectly the first time, congratulations! You got really, <i>really</i> lucky. And if your program <i>didn't</i> work as you expected it might&mdash;either because you mis-typed something, or because you're still trying to figure out how all of this works, well... welcome to the world of programming. We're going to be writing programs in here, but we're going to spend even more time trying to get the programs to work the way we want them to.</p>
                                    <p>It's kind of like solving a puzzle... and it's a <i>fantastic</i> feeling when you solve the puzzle and get your program to work!</p>

                                <p>You can see that we've introduced the file-naming convention that we'll be using throughout the course. It's important that each file you work on be identified, by assignment and by author. It's the equivalent of putting your name on your paper.</p>
                                <div class="definition">
                                    <p><b>File Naming Convention in this course</b>:</p>
                                    <p><i>assignmentName</i>-<i>lastnameFirstinitial</i>.py</p>
                                    <p>The assignment name will be given in class for each assignment. For exercises from the book, use this convention:</p>
                                    <p><i>ch02ex17-whiter.py</i>, where 02 is a two-digit code for the chapter, and 17 is the exercise number.</p>

                                    <p><b>Don't use spaces in your filenames.</b></p>
                                    <p>Most computer systems use a space (" ") to separate instructions, or parameters, or items in a list. Although modern operating systems allow for a space in a filename (<i>my program.py</i>, for example), it's not a good idea. When referring to such a program, you'll either have to "escape" the space by putting a backslash in front of it ( <b>python <i>my\ program.py</i></b>) or putting quotes around the filename (python "my program.py"), both of which require extra typing and effort on your part.</p>
                                    <p>There are two strategies for indicating "words" in a filename: use underscores or use capital letters. <i>my program.py</i> should be written as <i>my_program.py</i> or <i>myProgram.py</i>.</p>
                                </div>
                                <p>You'll also typically want to have two windows open simultaneously on your screen: one for the code that you're writing, and one for running that code. You'll switch back and forth between the two windows as you work, writing code in the window on the left, and then running the code in the window on the right to see how your program is coming along.</p>

                                <p>Programs include logical sections of code blocks, which in Python are called <i>suites</i>.</p>
                                <div class="definition"><p>A <b>suite</b> in Python is a logical block of code, identified at the beginning by a colon (:), with all lines indented exactly 4 spaces from the previous line.</p>
                                <p>NOTE: Do not use <b>[tab]s</b> to create your spacing unless you have configured your text editor to replace tabs with spaces. Four spaces may <i>look</i> the same as a [tab], but Python won't be able to run your program correctly. Also, although the "4 spaces" rule is not <i>required</i> by Python&mdash;you can actually use any spaced-indent for a suite, as long as the same indent is used consistently throughout the program&mdash;in here we'll be using 4-spaces, which is standard Python "best practice."</p></div>
                                <p>You could reasonably wonder why we should include in our program 3 blank lines, and 5 lines of comments that don’t make the program run any differently.</p>
                                <p>Experienced coders already know the answers to these questions, but you may not get it for awhile. Briefly:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The blank lines make the program easier to read, for you and anyone else who’s looking at your work.</li>
                                    <li>The comments identify important parts of the program, useful to you and anyone else who’s looking at your work.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <div class="problem">
                                <p>Now modify your program to include a <b>main</b> function, as follows:</p>

# Call the main function

</div>
                                </div><!--problem-->
                                <p>Here, the <b>def</b> instruction in Python defines a function called "main", which contains a bit of code that won't be run until the name is used later on in the program.</p>
                                <p>Down below, then, we "call the function" by writing "main()", which tells the interpreter to execute the instructions that we'd described earlier on in the function definition.</p>
                                <p>Again, you might wonder why we've made our straightforward program a little more complex by defining a function.</p>

                                A <b>loop</b> is a series of instructions that may be repeated over and over according to certain conditions.<br /><br />
                                In Python, there are two main types of loop structures: <b>for loops</b> and <b>while loops</b>.

                            <p>Did it work? If not, you'll have to debug the program to get it running.</p>
                            <p>Note that the <b>body</b> of the loop&mdash;the part that's going to be repeated over and over&mdash;gets indented 4 spaces as a code block. <i>Any statement that is indented, and thus in the code block, will be repeated as part of the loop.</i> When you don't want the next statement to be part of the body of the loop, you stop indenting. That next statement, then, is where execution of the program will begin <i>after</i> the loop has finished running.</p>
                            <p>What do you think the variable <i>i</i> was doing while the program ran through this loop?</p>

                            <p>This program uses a variable <i>i</i> to store a value that changes as the program runs. First the value 0 is stored in <i>i</i> during the first iteration of the loop, and the code block beneath is executed with the value 0 used anytime <i>i</i> is mentioned.</p>
                            <p>At the end of the code block, execution returns to the top of the code block, but now with <i>i</i> having a value of 1. The variable <i>i</i> gets successive values stored in it as the loop repeats over and over, 10 times, with <i>i</i> running from 0 to 9. After that, the loop stops, and execution continues on to the next line below the loop.</p>

                                <p>The <span class="ilc">ls -al</span> command tells the the shell to list <b>a</b>ll the files in the current directory (including hidden ones) in <b>l</b>ong format, so that we can see directory permissions, which are listed in the left column of the list.</p>                                  
                                <p>Let's take a moment focus on those directory permissions listed over on the left.</p>
                                <img src="images/permissions.jpg" />
                                <p>After the <b>d</b> which indicates that we're looking at a directory (containing files), there is a series of 9 characters, organized in groups of 3, and consisting of the letters r, w, x, or a dash ('-').</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>r</b> = "read" access</li>
                                    <li><b>w</b> = "write" access</li>
                                    <li><b>x</b> = "execute" access</li>
                                    <li><b>-</b> = no access</li>
                                </ul>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>First 3 characters: the user's (owner's) permissions for this file/directory</li>
                                    <li>Second 3 characters: the group's permissions for this file/directory</li>
                                    <li>Third 3 characters: the world's permissions</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>What does all this mean? In the example above, you can see that I (whiter) am the owner of the directory <i>whiter</i>, and I have <b>rwx</b> permission on this directory. For a directory, the <b>r</b> means that I can see the names of files in the directory, the <b>w</b> means that I can add, rename, or delete files, and the <b>x</b> means that I can read or write files in the directory, and execute files as programs.</p>
                                <p>The fact that the next three columns have "-" in them means that other people in my group do <i>not</i> have access, and the three columns of "-" after that mean that the world at large doesn't have access to the directory.</p>
                                <p>If you want to <i>change</i> permissions for a folder or a file, you use the <b>chmod</b> command.</p>
                                <img src="images/permission_changing.jpg" />
                                <p>There won't be much occasion for you to have to worry about permissions in this class, although you might be interested to know that permissions are critical for an instructor who wants to set up a Dropbox where you can submit assignments.</p>

                                <p>In addition to being able to work on the server, you'll be submitting your programming assignments to a Public folder on the server. For this you'll be using the <span class="ilc">scp</span> command.</p>
                                <div class="definition">
                                    <span class="ilc">scp</span> is used to securely copy files from one "source" computer (often your local machine) to another "destination" computer (often the class server) according to the following syntax:<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <span class="ilc">scp &lt;source&gt; &lt;destination&gt;</span><br />

                                In order to make this command work, you'll need to provide username and server information as part of the statement.</p>
                                <p>To securely copy a file from <i>my</i> local computer to <i>my</i> Documents directory on the server, I'd use this:</p>
                                <div class="code">$ <span style="color:#fff">scp my_file.txt whiter@crashwhite.polytechnic.org:Documents</span>

my_file.txt                     100%   11KB  11.4KB/s   00:01

                                <p>To securely copy a file from <i>your</i> local computer to the instructor's Dropbox on the server&mdash;which is what you'll do to submit assignments&mdash;you'll use this:</p>

$</div><!--code-->

                                <p><b>scp</b> is what you use to securely transfer files from one computer to another over the internet. If you're already logged on to the server and you want to copy something from your own home folder to the instructor's folder, you don't need to use the <span class="ilc">scp</span> command. You can just <span class="ilc">cp</span> your file into the appropriate folder.</p>
                                <div class="code">userid/Documents$ <span style="color:#fff">cp ch07ex02-userid.py /home/whiter/Public/Dropbox/ch07ex02</span>

</div><!--code-->   
                                <p>And speaking of submitting assignments, you'll need to make sure that your assignments are "turned in" (uploaded to the server) on time. Points will be assigned according to a rubric that will vary with the assignment, but a typical breakdown of points is along these lines:</p>

                            <p>Writing good software is challenging, but <i>fun</i>!</p>
                            <p>The process of writing a program involves quite a bit more than simply sitting down at the computer and entering code. A typical problem will require that you:</p>

                                <li>Design the program's overall structure</li>
                                <li>Write the program (lots of testing and debugging here)</li>
                                <li>Deliver the program</li>
                                <li>Maintain the program (updating it as required, repairing it as needed)</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>In this course, you'll often be provided with the first 2 items, and #6 won't typically be something you'll have to worry about.</p>

                                <p>Pseudocode is a “faux-language” that we can use to begin thinking about how we’re going to write a program. It allows us to think about input, output, branching and looping control structures without having to worry about the actual syntax of Python.</p>

#    Set up loop to run from 1 to the number of years
#        Based on values given, calculate new principal
#    Once loop is done, print out final principal

# Call the main function</div>
                            <p>Think of pseudocode as a hybrid language, halfway between English and actual code. It won't actually run on the computer, of course, but it's an important stepping stone to getting the program designed.</p>
                            <div class="code"># Actual program to determine result of investing money
def main():
    yearly_investment = input("Enter the amount to be invested each year: ")

        principal = principal + principal * apr

                            <p>For solutions provided by the instructor in this course, you'll often find a pseudocode version of the final program before the actual program. If you find you are having difficulty trying to figure out how to write a program, it may help to look at the pseudocode first, and then trying to write the program again on your own, without yet resorting to the actual solution.</p>

                                <p><b>Identifiers</b> are used to name programs, functions, modules, variables.</p>
                                <p>Python identifiers:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>must begin with a letter or underscore “_”</li>
                                    <li>must include only letters, digits, or underscores</li>
                                    <li>are case-sensitive</li>

                            <p>An important part of producing good, human-readable code is using identifiers that are "self-documenting": a variable used to refer to the user's name should be called <i>userName</i> or <i>user_name</i>, and not just <i>n</i>. It will take a fraction of a second longer to type the complete name when you're writing the code, but you'll save minutes or even hours later on when you're debugging the code.</p>

                                <p><b>Reserved words</b> in a programming language are those words that have special significance, and can't be used for other purposes by a programmer.</p>
                                <p>The reserved words in Python include:<br />

                        <h2>6. Numeric Data Types</h2>
                        <p>Programming languages represent different <i>types</i> of data differently, and it's important for you to be aware of what data type one is working with. Data types in Python include <i>int</i> (integers), <i>float</i> numbers (floating point, or decimals), <i>str</i> (strings, of text), <i>list</i> (for lists of things), <i>tuple</i> (kind of like lists, but immutable), <i>dictionary</i>...</p>
                        <p>To begin, let's look at several of the numeric data types, operations that can be performed on those numbers, and some of the ways we can work with those numbers using functions in the <b>math</b> module.</p>
                        <div class="level3">
                            <h3>6.a. Integers and Floating Point numbers</h3>
                            <div class="definition">
                                <i>Plain integers</i> are simply that: integers, i.e. numerical values without a decimal point. You can confirm the type of a number by using the <b>type()</b> function in interactive mode:</p>
                                <div class="code">>>> <span style="color:#fff">type(3)</span><span style="color:#0f0">
&lt;type 'int'&gt;</span></div>
                                <p>Integers have 32 bits of precision. If you need more than that, you'll need to use the <b>longint</b> data type, which has unlimited precision. Longint values are indicated with an "L" at the end of the number, i.e. 3L.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="definition">
                                <p><i>Floats</i> are floating point numbers, i.e. numerical values that <i>do</i> have a decimal point.</p>

                            <p>Why distinguish between the two? It's all about speed. It's far easier for computers to deal with integers, and therefore far faster for them to perform operations with integers. Differences in speed won't be apparent in <i>most</i> programs that we write, but for any program that performs the same operation thousands, million, or billions of times, working with integers where possible produces a significant increase in speed.</p>
                            <p>Of course, if you need to work with decimals (floats), then you'll have to use them where appropriate.</p>

                            <div class="definition">
                                <p>A <i>module</i> (sometimes called a <i>library</i>) is a program that contains a useful set of related functions.</p>
                                <p>To use a module in a program, use <b>import modulename</b> near the beginning of your program.</p>
                            </div>
                            <p>Let's see how to use the <b>math</b> module to perform calculations. Enter the following code in the Python interpreter.</p>
                            <div class="code">>>> <span style="color:#fff">import math   # Gets the entire math library</span>
<span style="color:#0f0">>>> </span><span style="color:#fff">r = 3</span>
<span style="color:#0f0">>>> </span><span style="color:#fff">circumference = 2 * math.pi * r    # use pi from library</span>
<span style="color:#0f0">>>> </span><span style="color:#fff">print circumference</span></div>
                            
                            <p>Other functions contained in the <b>math</b> module include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>e, log(x), exp(x)</li>
                                <li>sin(x), cos(x), tan(x), asin(x), acos(x), atan(x)</li>
                                <li>radians(x), degrees(x)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Python's trig functions require that the value given be in radians. So, to calculate the horizontal component of velocity for a jet traveling 200 meters/second at 30 degrees above the horizontal:</p>

                            <p>Note that if you forget to import the <b>math</b> module, you'll get an error.</p>
                            <p>For a more complete list of methods available in the <b>math</b> module, use <b>help(math)</b> after importing the module.</p>

                        <div class="level3">
                            <h3>6.c. Different ways to <i>import</i> a module</h3>
                            <p>Modules obviously provide a convenient way of expanding Python's capabilities beyond the <i>built-in functions</i> that are available any time Python executes a program.</p>
                            <p>We've already seen the traditional way of importing a module. Note that we have to indicate the module name (<b>math</b>) before we indicate the method we want to used from that module (<b>.pi</b>).</p>
                            <div class="code">>>> <span style="color:#fff">import math   # Gets the entire math library</span><span style="color:#0f0">
>>> </span><span style="color:#fff">circumference = 2 * math.pi * r    # use pi from library</span></div>
                            <p>This technique, at the start, is the recommended way to use a method from an imported module.</p>
                            <p>Another option, though, if you really only need the <b>pi</b> function, is this:</p>
                            <div class="code">>>> <span style="color:#fff">from math import pi  # Gets just the pi function</span><span style="color:#0f0">
>>> </span><span style="color:#fff">circumference = 2 * pi * r   # calculates using pi</span></div> 
                            <p>The advantage here is that you can just use the identifier <b>pi</b> all by itself, without having to also specify the module name. The disadvantage is that there is some potential for confusion between the <b>pi</b> that you've imported and any <i>other</i> <b>pi</b> variable that you might be using in your program. The likelihood of this happening in a small program is pretty low, but as your programs become more complex, clearly distinguishing between your local variables and those imported from modules will be important.</p>
                            <p>The previous example gets only the pi function. If you wanted to get all the functions from <b>math</b>, you would do this:</p>
                            <div class="code">>>> <span style="color:#fff">from math import *    # Gets all math functions</span><span style="color:#0f0">
>>> </span><span style="color:#fff">print pi, sin(pi/2)   # use any function directly</span></div>

                            <div class="problem">
                                In the Python interpreter, <span class="ilc">import math</span> and then <span class="ilc">print sin(0)</span>. Did you get the answer you expected?</br />
                                <br />
                                Now try <span class="ilc">print sin(math.pi/2)</span>, which should give you a value of 1. Did you get the answer you expect?<br />

                                Now try <span class="ilc">print sin(math.pi)</span>, which should give you a value of 0. Did you get the answer you expected?<br />
                                <br />
                                What happened?<br />
                                <br />
                                Let's try something easier. <span class="ilc">print 0.1 + 0.2</span><br />
                                <br />
                                What???!<br />

									This problem has to do with the way computers do math. Decimal numbers like 0.1 that we're perfectly comfortable with are represented as binary numbers in the computer, and in that conversion process, imperfections arise. Think of writing the fraction <b>1/3</b> as a decimal: <b>0.3</b> isn't exactly correct. Neither is <b>0.33</b>, or even <b>0.33333333</b>. Representing a fraction as a decimal occasionally causes problems, and the same is true of representing decimal numbers in binary form, which is what computers have to do.<br />

                            <p>Like a lot of things in life, a few minor tweaks here and there can pay off in big gains. How can you make <b>nano</b> a better editor?</p>
                            <p>It might be helpful if you could have Python identifiers indicated in a different color. It would be great if you could use the [Tab] key to space over 4 characters as required, rather than 8. It would be great if they were actually spaces, rather than the Tab character, which will mess up Python's ability to read the code.</p>
                            <p>A "resource file" that allows you to customize <b>nano</b> is what you need. One is available in the instructor's Public folder on the school server, and you can:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Use the <b>cp</b> command to copy it from the instructor's Public folder into your own home directory on the server, like this.
                                    <div class="code">$ <span style="color: #fff">cp /home/whiter/Public/.nanorc ~</span></div>
                                    Note that the file is "hidden" from normal directory listings&mdash;that's what the dot in front of the "nanorc" name indicates. It will show up in your listings, however, if you give the command <span class="ilc">ls -a</span>.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    You can also copy it onto a directory on your computer at home with a similar command, using <b>scp</b>:
                                    <div class="code">$ <span style="color: #fff">scp userid@crashwhite.polytechnic.org:/home/whiter/Public/.nanorc ~</span></div>
                                    This securely copies the file from the source (the instructor's Public directory, accessed via userid's login) to the home directory on your local computer (that's the "~"). Launch <b>nano</b>, write a Python program, and see the color formatting appears in your Terminal!
                                </li>
