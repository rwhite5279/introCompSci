			<h1>Online Teacher/Course/Text Evaluation Results</h1>
			<p>
			In March, 2011, I asked students to complete an online evaluation form for the course. In this form, they indicated how strongly they agreed or disagreed with twenty-three statements, and had the opportunity to submit written comments on four additional questions. Evaluations were performed in-class and submitted anonymously via a web-based evaluation form, in exchange for extra credit points.
			</p>
			<p>
			Many thanks to my students for their honest feedback on these forms.
			</p>
			<p>
			The results of the "multiple-choice" responses are summarized here:

					<td class="data">
						Website based lectures, relaxed atmosphere, homework and projects fun most of the time<br /><br />
						The chill nature of the class makes it easy to work and learn. The information we learn about is really interesting too because it involves things that we use everyday such as programs and websites. The projects, although difficult, are also interesting to make. It's great  learning about the programming language because it essentially runs today technological world.<br /><br />
						The website-based lectures are extremely useful.The relaxed atmosphere allows me to ask question whenever.<br /><br />
						I've found that the availability of the lectures online has made completing the assignments a lot easier.  It's also pretty laid back<br /><br />
						love the lectures and how they clearly convey information<br /><br />
						love the ability to look at what we've covered in class on the website.  It definitely is a lifesaver when working on the homework and projects.<br /><br />
						love the relaxed atmosphere of the class and how despite this feel, it's still very efficient and I get a lot of work done. I can see all of the information being useful in the future as well, even if I don't necessarily want to pursue a career in computer science.<br /><br />
						Sitting next to Matt Rossi. Also, I love access to the pseudo-code online and the independent projects.

					<td class="data" style="background: #ddd;"><b>27. List a few of your least favorite things about this class.</b></td>
					<td class="data">
						don't like how things are due at midnight, I would much prefer them to be due at 7 in the morning the day it is due, makes the night before a project due less stressful<br /><br />
						Homework can take a great deal of time to complete<br /><br />
						The homework assignments are sometimes tedious and occasionally dont apply to the things were learning. The projects can be very difficult sometimes also.<br /><br />
						The homework, but it's not that bad.<br /><br />
						It is definitely a class geared towards students who have computer programming experience.  I think that sometimes we don't have all of the knowledge that some of the assignments (especially in the book) require.<br /><br />
						would like more lectures dealing with the more concepts of computer science. Also maybe some more explanation of code that we see in class.<br /><br />
						Uh, sometimes the programs are a quite hard, but now that we're on HTML, its all good.<br /><br />
						Haven't hacked into the CIA mainframe yet<br /><br />
						The programming stuff can be really hard and frustrating sometimes.<br /><br />
						No complaints!<br /><br />
						The daily homework. Also, the class seems to be geared to people with a little programming experience, not necessarily beginners. At least the time seems too short for someone just starting to learn how to program.

				<tr>
				<td class="data" style="background: #ddd;"><b>28. Suggest some improvements to make the class better.</b></td>
					<td class="data">
						Maybey try having the class taught in the pc lab
						<br /><br />
						think we should learn how to use IDLE. 
						<br /><br />
						NO HOMEWORK!
						<br /><br />
						Sometimes during projects and assignments, we need to include some code in order to get the program to run well. However, many times the code isn't something that was taught to us in class, but instead we need to search for it. Sometimes we aren't given a starting point as to where to search.<br /><br />
						think that the difficulty of the projects and the nightly homework are completely different. Bridging the gap between the two might be helpful.  Also, homework should be due at 8 am.<br /><br />
						We should use the board often to illustrate concepts in computer science rather than through just writing or words. Like the time when we explained mutable and immutable objects, it really stuck in my head because of how it was shown on the board. And when you explained sorting on the board, it just made it all the more easier to visualize.<br /><br />
						Go over code as a class a little more<br /><br />
						more command lists.  can be on the website.  for example stuff like &lt;hl> and &lt;ul> appears in your examples but you cant really figure out what it means unless you google it, and I feel like there is similar stuff I would use but I don't know that they exist since they arent on your website or your examples.<br /><br />
						Maybe cut a little out of the curriculum and make the time frame a little longer for people to learn stuff in.
