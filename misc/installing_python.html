		<h1>Installing Python</h1>
		<p>For this course, you will almost certainly need to have a command line interface, Python, and IDLE installed on your computer. The way one goes about doing this varies depending on whether you're running a Windows, Apple, or Linux operating system. Preliminary instructions on how to go about installing Python on your home computer are given here, although you may reasonably consider <a href="#usb_flash_drive">using a USB flash drive</a>.</p>
		<h2>Apple OS X</h2>
		<p>Apple's OS X comes with Python installed. Simply open up a command-line interface (the "Terminal" application, at /Applications/Utlities/Terminal.app ) and enter <span class="code">$ python</span> to start it.</p>
		<p>(Although we won't be using it as part of this course, you may run the Integrated Development Environment IDLE by entering <span class="code">python -m idlelib.idle</span> at the command line.</p>
		
		
		<h2>Windows</h2>
		<p>Windows typically doesn't have Python installed on it, so you'll need to go to python.org to download the <a href="http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.3/">Python 2.7.3</a> <span class="code">.msi</span> installer file, and execute it to install Python on your machine. You should probably also install the "Python for Windows Extensions".</p>
		<p>You'll also want to install <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>, which will allow you to use your Terminal to connect to the course's server. When you run <b>setup.exe</b>, be sure to install <b>openssh</b>&mdash;you'll need that to be able to upload files to our server.</p>
		<p>Once you've got Python installed, you'll have three ways of running it&mdash;we'll be using all three in this course, at one time or another.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>To run interactive Python interpreter, run the Application <span class="code">Python (command line)</span></li>
			<li>...</li>
			<li>...</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Linux</h2>
		<p>Congratulations! All Linux distros come up with a command line interface installed, and many have Python already installed (at the prompt enter <span class="code">python</span> to start it).</p>
		<p>If Python is <i>not</i> installed, you can get it from <a href="http://www.python.org">www.python.org</a>&mdash;follow instructions at the website to download and install it on your machine.</p>
		<p>IDLE can be installed by using the package manager for you particular machine to get and install. In Ubuntu, for example, entering <span class="code">sudo apt-get install idle</span> will do this.</p>
		<p>Or, you can download the idle.tgz file, extract the files, use the Terminal to go to the main directory, and do the standard</p>
			<ol><li><span class="code">./configure</span></li><li><span class="code">make</span>, and </li><li><span class="code">make install</li></ol>
			<p>Classic!</p>

		<h2>Running from a USB Flash Drive</h2></a>
		<p>If you don't have access to your own machine or are unable to install software on your home machine, please consult the instructor regarding using a USB Flash Drive. Without too much difficulty, we'll be able to set up your flash drive so that you can:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>insert the drive into your home PC and boot into Ubuntu (Linux)</li>
			<li>use a text editor like <b>nano</b> or <b>gedit</b> to write programs and save them</li>
			<li>run Python</li>
			<li>run <span class="code">scp</span> to submit your assignments</li>
		</ul>
